3. #### **Setting Permissions**
 
    Next, set the nec^essary permissions for your app. If you only intend to post content, the `threads_basic` and `threads_content_publish` permissions should suffice. Additional permissions can be added later if needed.

    {% include article-ads.html %}

4. #### **Configuring OAuth**
 
    OAuth is a passwordless authorization process that allows users to access resources securely. You'll need to configure OAuth URLs for your app. If you don't have a website, you can use Postman to handle the OAuth flow.
    
    Use the following URL for Postman's Redirect Callback: 
    - https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback (postman app)
    - https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/browser-callback (postman in browser).

    {% include article-ads.html %}

5. #### **Adding Testers**
 
    If you want to invite specific people to test your app, you can add them as testers. However, this step is optional since OAuth will handle the authorization.

    If you are generating token for [ferret](github.com/bitesinbyte/ferret), you have to add your thread account as tester.

    To add test user, Expend App roles and click on Roles. Click on Add People and select Thread Tester. please note when you add a user as tester, it sends a invite, you have to accept that invite. 

    {% include article-ads.html %}

6. #### **App Settings**
 
    To make API calls to the Threads API, you'll need the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET. Be cautious with your client secret to prevent unauthorized access.

    App Settings: Find these values under App settings and then Basic.

    {% include article-ads.html %}

7. #### **Authorization**
 
    Now that everything is set up, you can request an authorization code by navigating to the following URL in your browser:

    https://threads.net/oauth/authorize?client_id=[CLIENT_ID]&redirect_uri=[REDIRECT_URL]&scope=[SCOPES]&response_type=code  

    SCOPES should be threads_basic,threads_content_publish
    
    You'll receive an authorization code at the redirect URL, which you can then use to request an access token.
    
    {% include article-ads.html %}

8.  ##### **Generate an Short Lived API Access Token**

    To convert the authorization code into an Short Lived access token, send a POST request:

      - Url : https://graph.threads.net/oauth/access_token
      - Method: POST
      - Headers:
        - Content-Type: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
      - Parameters:
        - client_id:[CLIENT_ID]
        - client_secret:[Client_SECRET]
        - grant_type:authorization_code
        - redirect_uri:https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/browser-callback
        - code: [CODE_FROM_LAST_STEP]
      - Response

        ```json
        {
          "access_token": "",
          "user_id": "abc"
        }
        ```

9. #### **Generating a Long-lived Access Token**

    Since short-lived tokens expire quickly, convert it to a long-lived access token:

      - Generate Token

        - Url: https://graph.threads.net/access_token?grant_type=th_exchange_token&client_secret=[CLIENT_ID]&access_token=[ACCESST_TOKEN_FROM_LAST_STEP]
        - Method: GET
       
        - Response

          ```json
          {
            "access_token": "",
            "id": ""
          }
          ```

      - You'll receive a long-lived access token, which you can use for extended access.

10. ##### **Securely Store Your Access Token**
  
    Treat your access token like a sensitive piece of information and store it securely. Avoid hardcoding tokens in your application code or sharing them indiscriminately.
