## How does LinkedIn v2/posts Api work?

![How API Works](/assets/img/posts/automation/linkedin-automation/api-flow.webp)

1.  #### Fetch Profile Information

    Before we create a post, we'll need to fetch the user's profile information. This step is essential because we require the user ID to associate the post with the correct LinkedIn account.

    - Url: https://api.linkedin.com/v2/userinfo
    - Method: Get
    - Headers

      - Authentication: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN

      ```bash
        curl --location 'https://api.linkedin.com/v2/userinfo' --header 'Authorization: Bearer '
      ```

    - <strong> Response </strong>

      ```json
      {
        "sub": "",
        "email_verified": true,
        "name": "",
        "locale": {
          "country": "US",
          "language": "en"
        },
        "given_name": "",
        "family_name": "",
        "email": "",
        "picture": ""
      }
      ```

      We will be using the value of the sub for future purposes.

2.  #### Upload Images (if any)

    If our post includes images, we'll need to upload them to LinkedIn's servers. This step ensures that our post displays correctly, especially for article previews or image-rich content.

    - ##### Fetch Upload URL

      To upload the image, we need to fetch the upload URL.

      - Url: https://api.linkedin.com/rest/images?action=initializeUpload
      - Method: POST
      - Headers
        - Authentication: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
        - LinkedIn-Version: 202401 (try to use any latest version)
        - X-RestLi-Protocol-Version: 2.0.0
        - Content-Type: application/json
      - Content:

      ```json
      {
        "initializeUploadRequest": {
          "owner": "urn:li:person:ID"
        }
      }
      ```

      ```bash
        curl --location 'https://api.linkedin.com/rest/images?action=initializeUpload' \
        --header 'X-RestLi-Protocol-Version: 2.0.0' \
        --header 'LinkedIn-Version: 202401' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
        --data '{
          "initializeUploadRequest": {
          "owner": "urn:li:person:ID" //REPLACE ID
          }
        }'
      ```

      - <strong> Response </strong>

      ```json
      {
        "value": {
          "uploadUrlExpiresAt": ,
          "uploadUrl": "",
        "image": "urn:li:image:"
        }
      }
      ```

      We will be using the value of the image for generating the url preview and uploadUrl for uploading the image

        curl --location --request PUT 'https://www.linkedin.com/dms-uploads/sp/' \
        --form 'file=@"android-chrome-512x512.png"'
