Hey there, welcome back to our journey in supercharging your Thread Account! In our [last chat](/posts/how-to-post-content-on-thread-using-api-part1), we talked about getting your hands on that special API access token tailor-made for creating posts on your Threads account. Now, armed with that token, let's dive into the fun part – crafting and scheduling posts using REST APIs.

TLDR
Please visit [https://github.com/bitesinbyte/ferret/blob/main/pkg/external/thread.go](https://github.com/bitesinbyte/ferret/blob/main/pkg/external/thread.go) for golang code.

## Why REST APIs, You Ask?

Alright, so let's break it down. REST APIs are like the magic wand for tech folks. They let you talk to all sorts of web services, and in our case, Thread's API is the one we're interested in. By tapping into these APIs, you can weave Threads right into your existing tools and workflows. It's like having a social media genie at your command, ready to whip up posts whenever you need them!

## Creating a Post

- Make sure you have the page token generated on [part 1](https://blogs.bitesinbyte.com/posts/how-to-post-on-facebook-page-using-rest-api-part1/#generate-an-api-access-token)
- Url: https://graph.threads.net/v1.0/[USER_ID]/threads?media_type=Text&text=[CONTENT_TEXT]&access_token=[ACCESS_TOKEN]
    - Method: POST
    - **Response**
      Example of a successful response
      ```json
      {
        "id": "page_post_id"
      }
      ```
- When you create a post, it will not be published, until you hit publish api.
