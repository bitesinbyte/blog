## Why?

If you have disabled local auth([Disable local authentication in Azure AI Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/disable-local-auth)), that means you can not use keys for AI service authentication.

## How to fix?

Make sure when accessing the AI service API do not use api keys instead try to use Managed service identities.

- Go to Azure AI service (In this case, I am using Azure Open AI Service), and go to Resource Management and select Identity

- Make sure you are in **System Assigned** Tab
- If the status is **Off**, please change it to **On** and save the generated ID for future use.
