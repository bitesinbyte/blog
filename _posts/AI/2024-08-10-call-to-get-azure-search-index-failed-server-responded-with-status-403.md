## How to fix?

### Assign Role

- Go to Azure AI Search Service (Formally known as Azure Search Service and Cognitive Search Service).
- You have to provide one of the following roles to open ai service

| Role  | Assignee  | Resource  | Description  |
|---|---|---|---|
|Search Index Data Reader| Azure OpenAI| Azure AI Search| Inference service queries the data from the index.|
|Search Service Contributor| Azure OpenAI| Azure AI Search| Inference service queries the index schema for auto fields mapping.<br>Data ingestion service creates index, data sources, skill set, indexer, and queries the indexer status.|

### Enable RBAC

- Go to Azure AI Search Service (Formally known as Azure Search Service and Cognitive Search Service).
- Under **Settings** section, click on **Keys**
- Under **API Access control** either select **Both** or **Role-based access control**, I would recommend using RBAC(Role-based access control)
