Last year when I was working on a project I also came across same question, I did some research I manage to find few sources but all of them were outdated so I decided to create my own gist for that.

{% include article-ads.html %}

this contains all the countries and there states and this list will update automatically every month so you donâ€™t have to worry about outdated data.

I am using geonames dumps to create this gist so if you find any incorrect data you can update at geonames side and it will reflect in next release.

{% include feed-ads.html %}

[Here](https://gist.github.com/manishtiwari25/0fa055ee14f29ee6a7654d50af20f095) you can find the gist.
