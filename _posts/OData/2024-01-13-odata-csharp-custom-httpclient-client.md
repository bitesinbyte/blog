A custom HTTP client is a generic HTTP client implementation that is created and configured specifically for a particular application or use case. It provides more control over the low-level details of HTTP requests and responses, allowing developers to tailor the client to their specific needs.

Comparison with other techniques is available [here](/posts/odata-csharp-benchmark)

## How to integrate in c#

For testing and development, I will be using a dummy service provided by [odata.org](<https://services.odata.org/V4/(S(y5tuj04bxbfsxzimbxbnauqg))/TripPinServiceRW/>)

This can be achieved using various approaches, but my favorite is by using `IHttpClientFactory`. For more about the HTTP Client factory, please visit the official Microsoft [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/httpclient-factory).

In `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`, add following

```cs


builder.Services.AddHttpClient("TripPinServiceRW",
    client =>
    {
        client.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://services.odata.org/V4/(S(y5tuj04bxbfsxzimbxbnauqg))/TripPinServiceRW/");
    });

```

Now in your service class add the following dependency

```cs

public class MyCustomDummyService(IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory)
{
    // Other code
}

```

And create a client

```cs

public class MyCustomDummyService(IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory)
{

    public async Task FechDummyData()
    {
         using var client = _httpClientFactory.CreateClient(TripPinServiceRW);

         // Other Logic
    }

}

```

Now you can just use httpclient method to fetch the data.

If you are working on a console app or something where you can't use the dependency injections, in that case, you can just create a new instance of HttpClient and use it.
you can get some code [here](https://github.com/manishtiwari25/bites-in-byte-blog/blob/main/src/ODataBenchmark/BenchmarkODataHttp.cs)

## Advantages of Custom HttpClient

- #### Flexibility and Control

Custom HttpClient provides complete control over the underlying HTTP requests and responses, allowing for fine-grained customization and tailoring to specific OData requirements.

- #### Efficiency and Performance

Direct manipulation of HTTP requests and responses can lead to optimized communication and better performance, especially for high-traffic scenarios or large data transfers.

- #### Support for Custom Headers and Payloads

Custom HttpClient allows developers to define custom headers and payloads for OData requests, enabling integration with specific OData service features or protocols.

- #### Integration with Existing Projects

Custom HttpClient can be easily integrated into existing projects, as it's a built-in .NET component. This eliminates the need for additional dependencies or learning new libraries.

- #### No Dependency on OData-Specific Libraries

Custom HttpClient doesn't rely on OData-specific libraries, making it more versatile and adaptable to different OData service implementations.

## Disadvantages of Custom HttpClient

- #### Increased Development Complexity

Implementing a custom HttpClient solution requires a deeper understanding of HTTP protocols and OData concepts, increasing the development complexity compared to using OData client libraries.

- #### Manual Error Handling

Custom HttpClient requires manual error handling, which can be time-consuming and error-prone compared to libraries that handle exceptions automatically.

- #### Data Mapping and Representation

Manually parsing and mapping OData responses to custom C# classes can be tedious and error-prone, especially for complex data structures.

- #### Potential for Performance Issues

Improper handling of HTTP requests or responses can lead to performance issues, such as inefficient data transfers or protocol violations.

- #### Limited Community Support

Custom HttpClient is not as widely used as OData client libraries, which may mean fewer resources available for troubleshooting and support.

## Use cases for custom HTTP clients

- #### Integration with non-standard OData services or APIs

When the OData client libraries don't provide adequate support for specific features or protocols, a custom HTTP client can be tailored to meet the requirements.

- #### Fine-grained optimization for performance or security

In scenarios where performance or security is critical, a custom HTTP client can be optimized for specific requirements.

- #### Integration with custom middleware or logging mechanisms

A custom HTTP client can be integrated with custom middleware or logging mechanisms to handle additional tasks or collect specific data.

- #### Experimental or research-oriented projects

For experimental or research projects, a custom HTTP client allows for more flexibility and experimentation with different approaches.

## Conclusion

In summary, Custom HttpClient provides maximum flexibility and control for fine-tuning OData interactions but comes with a higher development overhead and potential for errors. It's suitable for experienced developers who need to handle specific OData requirements or integrate with non-standard OData services. For simpler scenarios or projects with limited resources, consider using OData client libraries that offer a higher level of abstraction and automatic data handling.
